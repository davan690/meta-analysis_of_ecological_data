about: It would be great to include a chapter about how to use this reposority as a template and generate a meta-analysis for a different topic in ecology.

- I proppose that MADEr also cover the following topic:

Reproducible research

- Why do you think this is an important aspect of the Meta-analysis literature to include?

It is an approach which varies only slightly from what is demostrated within this text but needs to be included within each step of the process. This has become possible due to the prolificaltion of APIs and web app development. There are now tools and packages within the open-science community that make package writing much easier and quicker to produce. Reproducibility and replicate is made much easier with this approach (cite).

- Would you like to contribute to this topic, or are there any other collaborators we should contact to help out?

Yes, I have begun working through the current text and applying my research to this template and see how it looks(`github.com/davan690/meta_analysis_of_ecological_data/@main branch`). It has taken me some time to understand git and github but I find working in a `git flow` manner helps to keep my branch updated from the upstream branch (the original in this case) (cite).

From here I can add it to the upstream repository of the book as a fork or render it into a single RMD chapter. The later would be much too big I think.

After I have replicated the meta-analysis with my project from this repository it could be a helpful resource alongside the book to demostrate reproducible methods using APIs.

 We could look at writing a summary chapter within the MADEr book directly instead of a branch in the repository if other authors thought it contained enough additional information.
